# DRAWBIT

Drawbit is a multiplayer progressive web application where your best drawing and detective skills are put to the test! Race against the clock to either draw a word or guess the word being drawn.

## Getting Started

### Mobile Setup

- [React-Canvas-Draw](https://github.com/embiem/react-canvas-draw) - A Canvas drawing component built on top of React, which was used for our game components.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Used in conjunction with Socket.io to keep data transfer between all users real-time.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Our front-end framework.
